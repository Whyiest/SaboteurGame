## Overview
Welcome to "SaboteurGame," my second project developed as part of my academic curriculum. This project is a digital implementation of the popular card game "Le Saboteur." It showcases my growing skills in software development and my ability to translate complex game mechanics into a functional digital format.

## Game Description
"Le Saboteur" is a card game that involves players taking on the roles of miners or saboteurs. The miners aim to build a path to discover hidden treasure, while the saboteurs try to hinder their progress secretly. The game is known for its elements of strategy, deception, and teamwork.

## Key Features
- **Role Assignment**: Players are assigned roles as either miners or saboteurs.
- **Path Building**: Miners attempt to construct a path towards the treasure.
- **Sabotage**: Saboteurs work to covertly obstruct the miners.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Players must strategize and make decisions that will either aid in finding the treasure or prevent others from doing so.

## Rules of "Le Saboteur"
1. **Objective**: Miners aim to build a path from their starting point to the treasure, while saboteurs try to prevent them.
2. **Path Cards**: Players use these cards to build paths or block paths.
3. **Action Cards**: These cards allow players to take various actions like removing obstacles or destroying paths.
4. **Role Secrecy**: The miners and saboteurs do not know each other's identities, adding an element of mystery and strategy.
